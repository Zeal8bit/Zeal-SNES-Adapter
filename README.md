## SNES controller adapter for Zeal 8-bit Computer

The goal of this project is to create an SNES controller adapter PCB for Zeal 8-bit Computer.

This repository includes:
* An example/driver written in Z80 assembly to communicate with the adapter
* A Kicad (v6) project for the PCB board
* Gerber files for PCB. If you don't want or can't open the Kicad project and generate gerber files, you can directly download the gerber files and send them to your favorite PCB manufacturer.
